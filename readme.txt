Certainly! A requirements.txt file typically lists all the Python packages and their versions that are required for your project. In your case, where you are using TensorFlow and Flask, your requirements.txt file might look like this:

plaintext
Copy code
Flask==2.0.1
tensorflow==2.6.0
Pillow==8.3.2
Make sure to adjust the versions based on your project's specific requirements. You can find the installed package versions by running pip freeze in your project environment.

To create or update your requirements.txt file, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command will write all the installed packages and their versions to the requirements.txt file in the current directory. You can then include this file in your project repository or share it with others so they can install the same dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
